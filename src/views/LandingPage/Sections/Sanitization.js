            Sanitization systems aim to protect human health by providing a clean environment that 
            will stop the transmission of disease, especially through the fecalâ€“oral route. Diarrhea, 
            a main cause of malnutrition and stunted growth in children, can be reduced through 
            adequate Sanitization Like, Personal Hygiene, Household Cleanliness, Community Cleanliness.

            Too weak to attend work or school, many people are forced to buy expensive medicine, 
            becoming trapped in an endless cycle of poverty. As well as being a public health issue, 
            sanitization is also, undoubtedly, a major contributor to social injustice and poverty.
